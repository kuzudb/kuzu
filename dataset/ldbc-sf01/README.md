The used dataset here is from the LDBC Social Network Benchmark (LDBC-SNB) SF-0.1 dataset, which can be downloaded here https://repository.surfsara.nl/datasets/cwi/ldbc-snb-interactive-v1-datagen-v100/files/social_network-sf0.1-CsvBasic-StringDateFormatter.tar.zst.
Note that this is not an official LDBC benchmark, we only use the dataset for testing and demonstration purposes by ourselves.

The original LDBC dataset is subject to the following license terms:

# LDBC Data set license (2022/03/15)

LDBC BENCHMARK is a registered trademark of Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC). LDBC wishes to avoid mistaken or false claims that performance test results are LDBC benchmark test results. We are working on developing a policy on fair use of the term "LDBC benchmark" when reporting performance test results, backed up by the grant of trademark licences, or a commitment not to pursue those who follow our fair use policies for trademark infringement.

In the interim, you are not licensed to refer to any presentation of the results of running benchmark tests using these datasets using the words "LDBC benchmark" or anything that is likely to be reasonably construed as being equivalent in meaning to the words "LDBC benchmark". However, if you contact LDBC at info@ldbcouncil.org then we will discuss with you a form of words to describe or characterize any test results you produce in a way that accurately states the relationship of any report, presentation or other publication of those results to LBDC benchmark results, and which will avoid the possibility of you infringing our trademark inadvertently.
