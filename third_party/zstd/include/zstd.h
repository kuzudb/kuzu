/*******************************************************************************
  Introduction

  zstd, short for Zstandard, is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting
  real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios.
  The zstd compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression
  functions.

  The library supports regular compression levels from 1 up to ZSTD_maxCLevel(),
  which is currently 22. Levels >= 20, labeled `--ultra`, should be used with
  caution, as they require more memory. The library also offers negative
  compression levels, which extend the range of speed vs. ratio preferences.
  The lower the level, the faster the speed (at the cost of compression).

  Compression can be done in:
    - a single step (described as Simple API)
    - a single step, reusing a context (described as Explicit context)
    - unbounded multiple steps (described as Streaming compression)

  The compression ratio achievable on small data can be highly improved using
  a dictionary. Dictionary compression can be performed in:
    - a single step (described as Simple dictionary API)
    - a single step, reusing a dictionary (described as Bulk-processing
      dictionary API)

  Advanced experimental functions can be accessed using
  `#define ZSTD_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY` before including zstd.h.

  Advanced experimental APIs should never be used with a dynamically-linked
  library. They are not "stable"; their definitions or signatures may change in
  the future. Only static linking is allowed.

/*-***********************************************************************
*  Streaming compression - HowTo
*
*  A ZSTD_CStream object is required to track streaming operation.
*  Use ZSTD_createCStream() and ZSTD_freeCStream() to create/release resources.
*  ZSTD_CStream objects can be reused multiple times on consecutive compression operations.
*  It is recommended to re-use ZSTD_CStream since it will play nicer with system's memory, by re-using already allocated memory.
*
*  For parallel execution, use one separate ZSTD_CStream per thread.
*
*  note : since v1.3.0, ZSTD_CStream and ZSTD_CCtx are the same thing.
*
*  Parameters are sticky : when starting a new compression on the same context,
*  it will re-use the same sticky parameters as previous compression session.
*  When in doubt, it's recommended to fully initialize the context before usage.
*  Use ZSTD_CCtx_reset() to reset the context and ZSTD_CCtx_setParameter(),
*  ZSTD_CCtx_setPledgedSrcSize(), or ZSTD_CCtx_loadDictionary() and friends to
*  set more specific parameters, the pledged source size, or load a dictionary.
*
*  Use ZSTD_compressStream2() with ZSTD_e_continue as many times as necessary to
*  consume input stream. The function will automatically update both `pos`
*  fields within `input` and `output`.
*  Note that the function may not consume the entire input, for example, because
*  the output buffer is already full, in which case `input.pos < input.size`.
*  The caller must check if input has been entirely consumed.
*  If not, the caller must make some room to receive more compressed data,
*  and then present again remaining input data.
*  note: ZSTD_e_continue is guaranteed to make some forward progress when called,
*        but doesn't guarantee maximal forward progress. This is especially relevant
*        when compressing with multiple threads. The call won't block if it can
*        consume some input, but if it can't it will wait for some, but not all,
*        output to be flushed.
* @return : provides a minimum amount of data remaining to be flushed from internal buffers
*           or an error code, which can be tested using ZSTD_isError().
*
*  At any moment, it's possible to flush whatever data might remain stuck within internal buffer,
*  using ZSTD_compressStream2() with ZSTD_e_flush. `output->pos` will be updated.
*  Note that, if `output->size` is too small, a single invocation with ZSTD_e_flush might not be enough (return code > 0).
*  In which case, make some room to receive more compressed data, and call again ZSTD_compressStream2() with ZSTD_e_flush.
*  You must continue calling ZSTD_compressStream2() with ZSTD_e_flush until it returns 0, at which point you can change the
*  operation.
*  note: ZSTD_e_flush will flush as much output as possible, meaning when compressing with multiple threads, it will
*        block until the flush is complete or the output buffer is full.
*  @return : 0 if internal buffers are entirely flushed,
*            >0 if some data still present within internal buffer (the value is minimal estimation of remaining size),
*            or an error code, which can be tested using ZSTD_isError().
*
*  Calling ZSTD_compressStream2() with ZSTD_e_end instructs to finish a frame.
*  It will perform a flush and write frame epilogue.
*  The epilogue is required for decoders to consider a frame completed.
*  flush operation is the same, and follows same rules as calling ZSTD_compressStream2() with ZSTD_e_flush.
*  You must continue calling ZSTD_compressStream2() with ZSTD_e_end until it returns 0, at which point you are free to
*  start a new frame.
*  note: ZSTD_e_end will flush as much output as possible, meaning when compressing with multiple threads, it will
*        block until the flush is complete or the output buffer is full.
*  @return : 0 if frame fully completed and fully flushed,

*  Streaming decompression - HowTo
*
*  A ZSTD_DStream object is required to track streaming operations.
*  Use ZSTD_createDStream() and ZSTD_freeDStream() to create/release resources.
*  ZSTD_DStream objects can be re-used multiple times.
*
*  Use ZSTD_initDStream() to start a new decompression operation.
* @return : recommended first input size
*  Alternatively, use advanced API to set specific properties.
*
*  Use ZSTD_decompressStream() repetitively to consume your input.
*  The function will update both `pos` fields.
*  If `input.pos < input.size`, some input has not been consumed.
*  It's up to the caller to present again remaining data.
*  The function tries to flush all data decoded immediately, respecting output buffer size.
*  If `output.pos < output.size`, decoder has flushed everything it could.
*  But if `output.pos == output.size`, there might be some data left within internal buffers.,
*  In which case, call ZSTD_decompressStream() again to flush whatever remains in the buffer.
*  Note : with no additional input provided, amount of data flushed is necessarily <= ZSTD_BLOCKSIZE_MAX.
* @return : 0 when a frame is completely decoded and fully flushed,
*        or an error code, which can be tested using ZSTD_isError(),
*        or any other value > 0, which means there is still some decoding or flushing to do to complete current frame :
*                                the return value is a suggested next input size (just a hint for better latency)
*                                that will never request more than the remaining frame size.
