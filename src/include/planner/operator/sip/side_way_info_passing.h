 * We perform side way information passing in the following cases
 * 1. Inner hash join
 *
 * If we add semi mask on build side, position is ON_BUILD, direction is BUILD_TO_PROBE and
 * dependency is PROBE_DEPENDS_ON_BUILD (because scan need to be generated before semi masker).
 *
 * If we add semi mask on probe side, position is ON_PROBE, direction is PROBE_TO_BUILD
 * and dependency is BUILD_DEPENDS_ON_PROBE.
 *
 * 2. Unnesting correlated subquery
 *
 * When unnesting a correlated subquery, we first accumulate the probe plan and pass information to
 * the build side. Semi mask position is NONE, direction is PROBE_TO_BUILD and dependency is
 * PROBE_DEPENDS_ON_BUILD.
 *
 * 3. Optional match after update
 *
 * When performing optional match update, since we only have left join operator, update pipeline
 * is placed on the probe side. However, by semantic, optional match should scan updated result.
 * So we accumulate the probe side and make it the right-most pipeline to make sure update pipeline
 * is executed before optional match pipeline.
 *
 * TODO(Xiyang): it worth thinking if we should simply put outer plan always on the build side.
 *
 * We disable semi-mask-based sip in the following cases
 *
 * During join order enumeration, we might disable semi mask if probe side cardinality is large to
 * avoid large materialization probe side intermediate result.
 *
 * During filter push down, we disable semi mask if join condition is not id-based
