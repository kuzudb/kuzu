# For a node with large number of adjacent nodes, the varLengthAdjListExtend uses largeListHandler to fetch adjacent
# nodes. We want to test whether the largeListHandler works as expected with a large adjacent list.

# In the large list dataset, Node 0 extends to 0,..., 5000. Node (1...5000) extends to 5000. In level 1, there
# are 10001 nodes (Node 0 extends to 5001 nodes and Node (1...5000) extends to another 5000 nodes). In level 2 there
# are 15001 nodes (Node 0 from level 1 extends to 0...5000, the other 10000 nodes in level 1 all extend to Node 5000).
# In level 3 there are 20001 nodes, and in level 4 there are 25001 nodes.
# The total number of nodes in level 2, 3, 4 will be 15001+20001+25001=60003.
# In general the formula is this: nth level will have 5K + (n-1)th level's number of nodes and level 1 has 10001 nodes.
# So the nth level will contain 5K*(n+1) + 1 many number of nodes.
