# Kùzu WebAssembly In-Browser Example with Persistent IDBFS
This example demonstrates how to use the Kùzu WebAssembly build in a web browser with the persistent IDBFS filesystem. The first run of the example will create a new database and load some data into it. The second run will query the database and display the results. After running the example for the first time, you can refresh the page to see the query results.

## Usage
### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

### Bootstrap (copy the WebAssembly module)
```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

### Start the web server
```bash
npm run serve
```

### Open the browser
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Source Code
The source code for this example can be found in the `public/index.html` file. The file is a simple HTML file that includes the JavaScript code to interact with the WebAssembly module. Vanilla JavaScript is used and only kuzu-wasm is imported. No other dependencies are used.
