# Kùzu
Kùzu is an in-process property graph database management system (GDBMS) built for query speed and scalability. Kùzu is optimized for handling complex join-heavy analytical workloads on very large graph databases, with the following core feature set:

- Flexible Property Graph Data Model and Cypher query language
- Embeddable, serverless integration into applications 
- Columnar disk-based storage
- Columnar sparse row-based (CSR) adjacency list/join indices
- Vectorized and factorized query processor
- Novel and very fast join algorithms
- Multi-core query parallelism
- Serializable ACID transactions

Kùzu is being actively developed at University of Waterloo as a feature-rich and usable GDBMS. Kùzu is available under a permissible license. So try it out and help us make it better! We welcome your feedback and feature requests.

## Installation
### Precompiled binary
Precompiled binary of our latest release can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/releases/latest).  
### Python package
Our Python package can be directly install through pip.
```
pip install kuzu
```
### NodeJS package
```
npm install kuzu
```

We also support official C++ and C bindings. For more installation and usage instructions, please refer to [our website](https://kuzudb.com/).

## Getting Started
We take `tinysnb` as an example graph, which is under `dataset/demo-db/csv` in our source code, and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/tree/master/dataset/demo-db/csv).

### CLI

Start CLI with a database directory `./kuzu_shell ./testdb/`
```cypher
# Data definition
kuzu> CREATE NODE TABLE User(name STRING, age INT64, PRIMARY KEY (name));
kuzu> CREATE REL TABLE Follows(FROM User TO User, since INT64);
# Data loading
kuzu> COPY User FROM "dataset/demo-db/csv/user.csv";
kuzu> COPY Follows FROM "dataset/demo-db/csv/follows.csv";
# Querying
kuzu> MATCH (a:User)-[f:Follows]->(b:User) RETURN a.name, b.name, f.since;
```

### Python
```python
import kuzu

db = kuzu.Database('./testdb')
conn = kuzu.Connection(db)
# Data definition
conn.execute("CREATE NODE TABLE User(name STRING, age INT64, PRIMARY KEY (name))")
conn.execute("CREATE REL TABLE Follows(FROM User TO User, since INT64)")
# Data loading
conn.execute('COPY User FROM "user.csv"')
conn.execute('COPY Follows FROM "follows.csv"')
# Run a query.
results = conn.execute('MATCH (u:User) RETURN COUNT(*);')
while results.has_next():
  print(results.get_next())
# Run a query and get results as a pandas dataframe.
results = conn.execute('MATCH (a:User)-[f:Follows]->(b:User) RETURN a.name, f.since, b.name;').get_as_df()
print(results)
# Run a query and get results as an arrow table.
results = conn.execute('MATCH (u:User) RETURN u.name, u.age;').get_as_arrow(chunk_size=100)
print(results)
```

### NodeJS
```js
// Import library
const kuzu = require("kuzu");

(async () => {
  // Create an empty database and connect to it
  const db = new kuzu.Database("./test");
  const conn = new kuzu.Connection(db);

  // Data definition
  await conn.query(
    "CREATE NODE TABLE User(name STRING, age INT64, PRIMARY KEY (name))"
  );
  await conn.query("CREATE REL TABLE Follows(FROM User TO User, since INT64)");

  // Data loading
  await conn.query('COPY User FROM "user.csv"');
  await conn.query('COPY Follows FROM "follows.csv"');

  // Run a query
  const queryResult = await conn.query("MATCH (u:User) RETURN u.name, u.age;");

  // Get all rows from the query result
  const rows = await queryResult.getAll();

  // Print the rows
  for (const row of rows) {
    console.log(row);
  }
})();
```

Refer to our [Data Import](https://kuzudb.com/docs/data-import) and [Cypher](https://kuzudb.com/docs/cypher) section for more information.

## Build
To build from source code, Kùzu requires Cmake(>=3.11), Python 3, and a compiler that supports `C++20`.
- Perform a full clean build without tests and benchmark:
  - `make clean && make release`
- Perform a full clean build with tests and benchmark (optional):
  - `make clean && make all`
- Run tests (optional):
  - `make test && make pytest`

For development, use `make debug` to build a non-optimized debug version.
To build in parallel, pass `NUM_THREADS` as parameter, e.g., `make NUM_THREADS=8`.

After build, our CLI binary `kuzu_shell` is available under the directory `build/release/tools/shell/`.

### Building on Windows
Currently MSVC is the only supported compiler:

- In addition to the dependencies listed above, you will also need GNU Make and Ninja (E.g. with [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/): `choco install make ninja`).
- Build from within a "Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt" (or manually run vcvars64.bat for cmd or Launch-VsDevShell.ps1 for powershell. See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/how-to-enable-a-64-bit-visual-cpp-toolset-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170) and [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022) for details).
- Run `make release`, or the commands listed in the previous section.

You can also build within Visual Studio, as long as you run `make release` first (or `make debug`), and then use [the CMake plugin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio).
